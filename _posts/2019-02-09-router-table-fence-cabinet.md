I've finally completed my router-table-in-the-table-saw-wing. This features a much upgraded fence over "v1", and massive amounts of storage.

The marquee feature is [Precision Router Lift](https://www.kregtool.com/store/c41/routing-accessories/p457/precision-router-lift/) from the video sponsor, Kreg. Thanks for making this happen Kreg!

Kreg's lift allowed me to take full advantage of Timbecon's new [round router body](https://www.timbecon.com.au/routing/router-tables-accessories/round-body-router-motor) (round body routers are rare in Australia).

I also took advantage of several Kreg tools that make cabinet making a breeze

*   [K4 Master Jig](https://www.kregtool.com/store/c13/kreg-jigsreg/p34/kreg-jigreg-k4/)
*   [Cabinet Hardware Jig](https://www.kregtool.com/store/c60/hardware-jigs/p409/cabinet-hardware-jig/)
*   [Concealed Hinge Jig](https://www.kregtool.com/store/c60/hardware-jigs/p408/concealed-hinge-jig/) (this is the hidden gem in Kregs library that really should get more attention than it does, in my opnion)
*   [Shelf Pin Jig](https://www.kregtool.com/store/c60/hardware-jigs/p80/shelf-pin-jig-with-frac14-6mm-drill-bit/)

Part one covers the router table top, and the fence. 

Part two covers the storage and dust collection.

Router Bit Holders
------------------

I mentioned that I'm using "router bit tidies" that were $2.50. They're dovetailed to join together, and come in 1/4″ and 1/2″ shank flavours. [I picked mine up from Timbecon](https://www.timbecon.com.au/routing/router-bit-accessories/router-bit-tidies)

Alternatively, if you have a 3D printer, I took Rockler's [Router Bit Storage Insert](https://github.com/thewoodknight/3DPrints) and modelled up something you can use. I'd recommend tweaking it a bit to get it "right", mine was more for proof of concept. You can find my files on [GitHub](https://github.com/thewoodknight/3DPrints). However, there are plenty of other designs on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=router+bit&dwh=205c5e8ad2cfff3).
