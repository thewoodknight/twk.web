Makeblock have sent me their latest and greatest diode laser, the D1 Pro, for review. This happens to be the 20 watt model - currently the highest powered laser diode on the market - along with their rotary axis and air assist. 

Standard disclaimer here, I’m not being paid for this review and Makeblock won’t be seeing the video before its published. I get to keep the machine, but I can also say nasty things about it if I want. Neat!
