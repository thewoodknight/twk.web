On one particular video (funny how that always goes!) I recieved four comments asking about the glues I use, and why I use them.

The best way to address this is with a short, coherent video, so naturally an overly long rambly video was made.

Sidenote: I'm not particularly brand loyal to Titebond, but when it comes to liquid hide glue its the most readily available in Australia. And it's pretty good.
