When making stopped dados/grooves in small pieces, it can be dangerous or at least uncomfortable at the router table, but difficult to clamp the workpiece if you're using a plunge router with edge guide. This very simple jig takes care of the work holding making it super easy and safe to make those cuts. This is based on [Eric Sorensen's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEU3Jw7bHrw), however I used wedges instead of clamps.
               
There are pros and cons to both versions -- my version is a bit more compact and cheaper, but doesn't have the same range as Eric's. I'd have to remake mine and use a series of spacers to achieve the same sort of range, and it'd get clumsy pretty quickly.
