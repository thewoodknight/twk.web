Bosch sent me out their drill press, the PDB40, to review. It's a little drill press, but light weight and plenty capable.

Great for wood, OK for aluminium, not that much chop for steel -- though it will do it in a pinch. If you're a metal worker, you're better off with the larger, more powerful "traditional" drill presses.
