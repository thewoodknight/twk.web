[There is a dimensional drawing -- its a bit rich to call it plans, but hey, its free!][1]

Commercially available blast gates _suck_. They leak air, they're a poor fit if you use PVC for your ducting, they jam up because of the design, and they fall apart because they're held together with hot glue.

The blast gates I made solve all these problems.

You can also find the project template up on [Inventables website, if you use Easel and want to hit &#8216;carve'.][2]

Parts used:

  * 100mm PVC pipe <a class="yt-uix-servicelink " href="https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-100mm-x-1m-pvc-dwv-pipe_p4770090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-100mm-x-1m-pvc-dwv-pipe_p4770090" data-servicelink="CPABELZ1IhMIoIzeq4-z1QIVzJ5YCh1vgAuF" data-target-new-window="True">https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-100mm-x-1m-pvc-dwv-pipe_p4770090</a>
  * 100mm PVC coupler <a class="yt-uix-servicelink " href="https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-industries-100mm-dwv-pvc-straight-coupling_p4750199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-industries-100mm-dwv-pvc-straight-coupling_p4750199" data-servicelink="CPABELZ1IhMIoIzeq4-z1QIVzJ5YCh1vgAuF" data-target-new-window="True">https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-industries-100mm-dwv-pvc-straight-coupling_p4750199</a>
