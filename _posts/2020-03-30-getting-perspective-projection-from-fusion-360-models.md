## [Wings3D][1]
For Wings3D, use the mouse wheel to zoom, middle mouse button to enter orbit mode and left click to stop. Arrow keys to pan.  

## [Blender][2]
I had more success with Blender 2.79 than with 2.80. I'm not really sure what the difference in FreeStyle render is, but some lines were consistently inconsistent in the later version. 

Shift + F in camera view will enable &#8216;fly mode', allowing you to use arrow keys (or WASD) to pan/navigate around, and your mouse to pivot. Use mouse wheel to speed up or slow down the movement.
