When Bosch sent out their [GOF 1600 CE Router that I reviewed last month][1], they also sent along the GKT 55 GCE track saw, 1600mm track, and two track clamps.

### Specs

  * 1400w motor with constant electronic power management
  * 165mm diameter blades
  * 55mm depth of cut at 90°
  * 42mm depth of cut at 45°
  * Angle adjustment from -1° to +47° cutting angle

If you've been following me along for any length of time you'll know I'm a fan of tracksaws, particularly for breaking down sheet goods, having used a rebranded Scheppach tracksaw as my only circular saw for a long time. As such, I didn't know what to expect when faced with a trade grade saw. Sure, it costs twice as much as the Scheppach, but what could it do differently?

From the first time I turned on the GKT 55 GCE, I have to be honest it felt like they were entirely different types of tools. Just about every misgiving I've had with the cheaper, Scheppach tracksaw is a non issue with the Bosch GKT 55 GCE.

### Ergonomics

Just like the router, Bosch have done a stellar job of all the ergonomics

  * the angle of the handle is perfect -- not positioning your arm awkward in any stage of the cut
  * the spring tension is much lower than the Scheppach, but not so low that it'll fly out of your hand
  * my wifes first impression of the saw was "this is the first circ saw I've used that hasnt' tried to kill me", because of her smaller hands.

### Dust Collection

If I thought the dust collection on the router was good, I was absolutely blown away with the saw. In typical Bosch fashion its listed as "efficient dust collection", but if they told me it was 99% efficient, I'd believe that. When flipping down the extra dust collection hood at the front, I noticed less than a teaspoon of dust after cutting down 5 sheets of melamine. My only complaint regarding the dust collection is the port -- it is on the shorter side, meaning there isn't a lot of friction engagement for the dust hose and it can pop loose from time to time.

### Cut quality

The stock blade is a 48t Frued-made blade that leaves a great surface quality cut. A &#8216;scoring mode' found on many other tracksaws which restricts the blade to ~2mm depth of cut would be nice, but the relatively quick cut depth adjustment mitigates that somewhat.

### Track

The track design is shared with Mafell and is surprisingly good. What is surprising is that it doesn't look like a set of t-track extrusions like most other tracks. It's smaller, making it lighter, but works just as well (if not better) than others. The lengths -- in my opinion -- are the best available. The standard length being 1600mm instead of 1400mm makes crosscuts on a sheet of plywood much easier as the 200mm hanging off either end of the sheet of ply give better start/stop areas to rest the saw in.

The downside is that the accessories are Bosch (and Mafell) only -- things like the track clamps need to have very thin heads compared to normal track clamps.

### Motor power

Tracksaws are often relegated to sheetgoods only, a relatively mild task (depending on thickness!) for a 1400w saw. In fact I questioned whether I had set the cut depth correctly, because on 16mm melamine and the 12mm phenolic coated ply I had to cut, felt like it wasn't cutting anything as I pushed it along the track as it was that smooth. I needed to trim down and mitre a slab of redgum for a coffee table I'm making. 45° through 50mm (I hand sawed the parts the bosch saw couldn't reach) thick redgum isn't a task I'd give my tablesaw in a single pass -- so with the GKT55GCE I went ~25-30mm at a time.

### TL;DR

#### ???? Good

  * 1400w motor beats out the competition
  * Best-in-class dust collection
  * Best track lengths available
  * Great ergonomics
  * Bosch AU imports all the accessoriers

#### ???? Bad

  * No riving knife
  * Comparitively priced, but "feels" more expensive as it comes with no carrying box/container
  * Scoring mode would be handy, but not a real negative
