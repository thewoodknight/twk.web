This is an "outdoor kitchen cabinet" for my inlaws. The design is similar to my sharpening station and was actually the inspiration as the father in law liked it.

This project started in March, but there were numerous delays, including my broken ribs. It was designed within constraints of budget, size, and for specific area use, so some things are done in different ways than what would normally be done.

And every project should start with a cup of oolong.

The entire video is shot using just a single lens -- the 50mm f/1.8. On a crop format camera, thats closer to 76mm, so in some shots its a bit too tight, so I also screwed on a "macrowider" my dad had from the '70s which turns a 50mm into about a 35mm- or on a crop factor camera-about 50mm equiv!
