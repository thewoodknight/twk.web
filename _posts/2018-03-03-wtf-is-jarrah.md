Jarrah (thats Eucalyptus marginata, not E. Margarine) is a tree native to Western Australia. Rich red colour, heavy, and abusive towards your tools.

[I've put up a small playlist of jarrah projects from others](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIAY4op1Uapg1h3im2Xw53YfmEoGP6dca&disable_polymer=true)
