To match in with the [Shogun bed][1], we needed to make some bedside lamps.

LEDs are the common SMD5050 12v strip lights, which makes them super easy to power. The paper is the 'proper' shoji paper.

It needs another coat of finish, but not too bad for all scraps -- the redgum is offcuts from the coffee table, and the tassie oak is from the JJJ bed build.
