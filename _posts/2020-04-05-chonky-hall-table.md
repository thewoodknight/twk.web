My sister, Laura, didn’t want anything "fancy" or overly expensive for a hall table in her new house but needed to fill a space. Of course, "not too fancy" quickly became "this specific thing I found on Pinterest".  
  
This isn’t my original design -- I don’t know whose it is, I am just working off the one super low resolution screenshot I was provided. The dimensions are also designed to fit her space, not necessarily the dimensions I think would be best for most cases -- this is a fairly narrow and chunky table.

If you do end up making something like this for yourself, I'd strongly encourage you to make it 100-150mm (4-6") lower than what is listed in the plans.
