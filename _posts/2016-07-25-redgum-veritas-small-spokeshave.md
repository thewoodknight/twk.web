Okay teeeeechnically I didn’t make this project, Natalie did. I think that skirts by the rules though, right?

[Veritas have two wooden spokeshave kits][1], this is the small. Overall would rate the project 3.5/5 – some of the wording was pretty so so, and a few things were the wrong size (had to go up a size drill bit) when following said instructions. Also very frustrating being all freedom units.

Fun project, I was the ‘instructor’/helper, wife did all the actual building. It was nice to do a short project together.

Blonde shellac (french polished) for the finish – provides a great tactile feel.

This was from an offcut of redgum from my coffee table. Other offcuts got turned into a lamp
