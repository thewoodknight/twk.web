### [Plans available](/product/gamingtable/)

We play board games with friends often, and when at their place they have a boring "normal person" table. While they have one on order from a known Kickstarter, it won't arrive until 2022!

I couldn't wait that long to have a better gaming experience, so the TWK Gaming Table Prototype was born, learning from how we enjoy playing games from The Wood Whisperer gaming table I built a few years ago.

This is designed to be flat-packable, but incredibly sturdy, and fits more games more better.
