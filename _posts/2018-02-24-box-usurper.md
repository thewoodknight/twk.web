Inspired by [Box Throne][1]Â but turned off by the metal looks, I wanted to make an attractive adjustable height shelf wooden storage cabinet for all my board games. Thus, Box Usurper was born. It utilises saw tooth shelves for the adjustable mechanism -- more attractive and pointy than the average shelf pin!
