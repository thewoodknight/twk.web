 My offcut storage shelf never seems to get any less full, so I thought it was time to challenge myself to complete a few projects where no new wood was bought. First up, a decorative box.

Tools Used
----------

*   Table Saw
*   Jointer
*   Thicknesser
*   Bandsaw
*   [Box Joint Blade Set](https://amzn.to/2n03tnq) (others, like Oshlun, make cheaper sets, or just use a regular dado stack)
*   [Incra IBox](https://amzn.to/2n1tB1n)
*   Router Table
*   Foredom SR

Box construction

The first step is getting the offcuts flatten. A quick trip to the jointer cleans up the face and edge.

Because I'm resawing the board, I like to also run it through the thicknesser/planer so that it has two square/parallel faces (and one square edge). This way, after resawing, all I have to do is run it through the thicknesser again to clean up the bandsaw marks, rather than going through the full resawing process again.

I'd initially thought I'd make a much chunkier box, but I ended up resawing the boards twice to yield three pieces at about 3/8″ (9.5mm) each. This is perfect for giving me two test pieces (one for each length) to setup other machines and jigs for joinery, grooves, etc.

For the blade, I'm using Freud's Box Joint Blade Set. It is a ‘special' type of dado -- no shims, no spacers, no chippers, just two blades which depending on the orientation will either cut at 1/4″ or 3/8″ groove. It isn't a "general purpose" dado blade, so the grind is specifically for box joints -- a very flat, square tooth.

I'm using Incra's iBox for the box joints. It isn't the fastest box joint jig, but its configuration is dead simple to get great results. There are other commercial jigs out there, as well as plenty of DIY options on Youtube. If you are more inclined to build than buy, checkout the [Wood Gears  Screw Advance Box Joint Jig](https://woodgears.ca/box_joint/jig.html)

A groove is needed to fit the top and bottom panels (which haven't been made yet!). 

Using power tools, there are really two (correct) ways to go about it -- a router table, or a plunge router. A plunge router is a little safer, but on small pieces like this is going to be more awkward.

The third/incorrect way is to use a dado stack on a table saw -- this is the wrong way to do it because it will result in the grooves being visible in the end product, unless it gets plugged later.

Carving
-------

For the panel in the lid, I wanted to carve something relatively simple in fitting with the theme of the box. I went with a simple zen garden inspired design -- some parallel lines lines and concentric circles.

All my carvings start off by drawing directly on the work piece -- in this case I was carving on the line. In other cases you may wish to carve between the lines, leaving the lines as peaks.

Tool wise, I use a Foredom SR, a form of rotary tool with a flex shaft. A Dremel with a flex shaft would work too -- in my case my burrs tend to be 1/4″ shanks, while Dremel's will only accept up to 1/8″.

There are two types of grip that I use with rotary tools -- the "pencil" grip and a "peeler" grip.

With the peeler grip (above), hold the tool like you would peeling a potato,thumb towards you, and pulling the tool towards you. With the correct cutter rotation set, the burr wants to pull away from your body, not towards it. This type of grip is great for straight lines and for hogging out material.

While I did try to use the peeler grip for the circles, I ended up fighting the grain too much and switched to the pencil grip. The early and late wood have significant enough hardness differences that when carving it can cause a loss of control using the peeler grip. I get best results with the pencil grip making quick, very shallow passes, rather than trying to take fewer, deeper cuts.

One becomes Two, Two get Joined
-------------------------------

Glue up for something like a box is pretty straight forward, everything is nice and square. Box joints are also (to some degree) self squaring. 

There are a few little tips to make it easier. First, use hide glue or epoxy, rather than typical PVA wood glue.  The water in the PVA will cause the joints to swell slightly, which will cause a lot of friction and difficulty in getting the joints together. By contrast, hide glue or epoxy will lubricate the joint, making it easy to close up with just hand pressure.

I use Titebond's Liquid Hide glue -- it's quick and easy, and more importantly -- available in Australia! 

Put glue on the inside faces of the box joints, on one side should be suffice.

A scrap of wood can be used to help seat the box joints. The scrap helps distribute pressure (and protect the box). You don't want to wail on the box joints themselves, as they stick proud of the surface.

Test box joint pieces can be used as cauls if you really want. For a small box, it isn't really needed.

Cleanup can be done using a block plane, chisel, or sandpaper.
