Over the years I've had a lot of questions, here are some of the most commonly asked...

    I'm just one dude, sharing what I make. There isn't a team to answer and filter out emails.
    When I did have the contact form up, the vast majority of emails I recieved were (in no particular order)

    <ul>
      <li>Spam</li>
      <li>Questions about a video with no context to the video, which would have been better as a comment on said video</li>
      <li>Questions about where to buy tools or wood, while not having the decency to provide where in the world they were</li>
      <li>Specific questions about tools that I don't own, that were under warranty, and could have been asked of the manufacturer</li>
    </ul>
  {% endcapture %}

    question="Why can't I find your email/contact form?"

  {% include accordion_object.html

    question="But seriously, I'm in Australia, where can I buy wood?" 
    answer="Never has this been asked by somebody without 3 hours drive of me." %}

    Typically, I'm using whats sold as "KD HWD F17", which is a construction graded label for Victorian Ash (which is also known/sold as Tasmanian Oak, Mountain Ash, Messmate, etc).<br /><br />

    The main difference with "construction graded" is it is to do with strength (pine is ~F5) and flaws, rather than appearance at all. I have to accept a little bit more "character", but it is considearbly cheaper

  I'm constantly surprised at how popular the countersink bit is â€“ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7L2MMX7L_M">I even made a video to directly address it!</a>.
  I use a combination of zero-flute countersink bits and Carbitool countersink
