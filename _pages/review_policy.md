#### The customer comes first
My goal is to provide an honest review for my audience so that they can make an informed decision. By sticking to these principles, it treats the audience with respect and value is added to the reviews with a track record of honesty and openness.

* I don't accept payment for reviews. Payment for a review transforms it from a review into an advertisement and masquerading as such is a dishonest conflict of interest. Where an item is provided free of charge for review, this will be disclosed clearly in the video description.

* Once the review terms are agreed to by both parties, a poor product experience is not grounds for the review to be cancelled or deleted to avoid negative publicity. Customers expect to buy products that are adequately developed and tested to ensure performance, reliability and safety.

* Should there be mistakes/inaccuracies with the review, the original video will be deleted at the company's request, and a video with corrections will be uploaded to maintain accuracy and fairness.

* I will not be held liable for any negative publicity, loss of sales, investment, etc that comes from any review. It is the company's responsibility to create a product that performs well against its competitors.

* While my videos are watched globally, I am in Australia, and as such products must be available for other Australians, including available in 230v/50hz (where applicable), and if located overseas must be able to be shipped to Australia without the use of shipping forwarding services.

#### Timeline and Communication
* Typical reviews will take four (4) to six (6) weeks after recieving the product. This allows for proper time spent with the product to make sure it works in real world situations. Depending on the complexity of the product, this could be much shorter or longer. 

* Issues that require replacement components/products (dead-on-arrival, etc) to be sent will slow down the timeframe and extend the release date.

* Unless explicitly stated and agreed upon by all parties, there is no defined deadline for a review to be released.

* For major issues, I will endevour to contact the company through regular customer support when there is no deadline, and in the interest of time when there is a deadline, through the designated contact from the company.


#### Publishing
* The name of the company, the name of the contact from the company, and the name of the product may be included in the title, thumbnail, description, tags and any other metadata.

* Images of the product and company logo may be used on the thumbnail.

* A range of links to sites where the product is for sale may be included in the description. These will often be affiliate links, as is standard practise among YouTube creatores.

* Videos on my channel are monetised via YouTube advertisements.

#### By proceeding with the review process, you hereby agree to all of the terms presented in this document.
