Small parts can be difficult to route - do you awkwardly clamp it in a handscrew clamp and take it to the router table? Do you try and balance a plunge router on top of it? Worse is when you need a stopped dado for a floating panel and have to awkwardly plunge at the router table.

I've *never* liked plunging at the router table - it has always felt super sketchy to me.

This simple jig creates a platform to rest a large router on, a nice square edge for the edge guide to reference off and securely locks the workpiece in place without clamps getting in the way, thanks to the wedges.

This is version two of the jig, with highly recommended reference pins and repeatable stops.
